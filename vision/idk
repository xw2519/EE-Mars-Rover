- added uart over IO0 and IO1 to communicate with control subsystem.
- Set camera to always use maximum zoom and maximum exposure,
could implement variable exposure and gain later.
- Detect balls using colours.
- Exploit the fact that the environment is a flat plane.
Only need to use x coordinates of beginning and end of balls.
- Need sine to determine distance from obstacles,
using fixed point approximation instead of sending data to command
to reduce latency.

- How to find balls:
Yellow : Find places where "green[7:1] + red[7:2] + blue[7:2]" is large.
Pink : ((red>=192)&(green<128)&(blue<128)) or similar has to be true.
Blue : ((red<32)&(green<32)&(blue>=32)) finds darker areas.
