\section{Aim}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The aim of the project is to design and build an autonomous rover system that could be used in a remote location without direct supervision.

\end{figure}


The rover will have the following main functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Receive movement commands and send status data through a processing unit.
    \item Detect and avoid obstacles in its working area.
    \item Build a map of its local working area including obstacles on an offsite data store.
    \item A charging station will be designed and implemented to charge the rover batteries.
\end{itemize}
